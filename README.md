- I started learning programming languages: C++ in 2021 and C# in 2022, when I was in my 2nd and 3rd years of college.
Before that, we were taught Pascal at school, and at home I made simple Lua games and mods.

- I am developing in the areas of programming that interest me:
  * Frontend developer;
  * Backend developer;
  * Fullstack developer;
  * C/C++ developer;
  * Game developer.
